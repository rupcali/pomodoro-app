# pomodoro-app
A simple Pomodoro timer application built with Python and the tkinter library.


## Overview

This Pomodoro timer application helps you manage your work and break intervals effectively. It follows the Pomodoro technique, allowing you to work for a set time, take short breaks, and a longer break after a series of work intervals. The timer keeps you on track, and you can easily start and reset it as needed.


## Features

- Customizable work and break intervals.
- Visual cues with color changes and checkmarks.
